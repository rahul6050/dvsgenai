    Optimize JSON schemas in a single traversal for better performance.

    This function combines three schema cleanup operations that would normally require
    separate tree traversals:

    1. **Remove unused definitions** (prune_defs): Finds and removes `$defs` entries
       that aren't referenced anywhere in the schema, reducing schema size.

    2. **Remove titles** (prune_titles): Strips `title` fields throughout the schema
       to reduce verbosity while preserving functional information.

    3. **Remove restrictive additionalProperties** (prune_additional_properties):
       Removes `"additionalProperties": false` constraints to make schemas more flexible.

    **Performance Benefits:**
    - Single tree traversal instead of multiple passes (2-3x faster)
    - Immutable design prevents shared reference bugs
    - Early termination prevents runaway recursion on deeply nested schemas

    **Algorithm Overview:**
    1. Traverse main schema, collecting $ref references and applying cleanups
    2. Traverse $defs section to map inter-definition dependencies
    3. Remove unused definitions based on reference analysis

    Args:
        schema: JSON schema dict to optimize (not modified)
        prune_titles: Remove title fields for cleaner output
        prune_additional_properties: Remove "additionalProperties": false constraints
        prune_defs: Remove unused $defs entries to reduce size

    Returns:
        A new optimized schema dict

    Example:
        >>> schema = {
        ...     "type": "object",
        ...     "title": "MySchema",
        ...     "additionalProperties": False,
