    Provider semantics:
        - Return `None` from `get_*` methods to indicate "I don't have it" (search continues)
        - Static components (registered via decorators) always take precedence over providers
        - Providers are queried in registration order; first non-None wins
        - Components execute themselves via run()/read()/render() - providers just source them

    Error handling:
        - `list_*` methods: Errors are logged and the provider returns empty (graceful degradation).
          This allows other providers to still contribute their components.
